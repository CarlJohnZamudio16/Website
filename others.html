       <h1 class="h1f"><span class="br">SUMMARY</span></h1>
        <p class="p2"><span>Three years after Boruto's defection, Shikamaru is the acting Eighth Hokage, and everyone but Sarada and Sumire think Boruto is Konoha's enemy. They try to probe Ada on ways to undo Omnipotence's effects, while still trying to appear entranced to her. Despite supporting Mitsuki's vigilance against Boruto, Kawaki is cold towards him. Himawari trains with Chōchō, still having faith in Boruto, her experiences with Kawaki protecting her having shifted to Boruto, and believing her father to still be alive. Code sneaks several Claw Marks through Konoha and begins an attack with his Claw Grimes, hoping to draw Boruto out. Boruto arrives just in time to protect Sarada from Code. Boruto's battle with Mitsuki unfolds which then leads to an enlightening realisation for Mitsuki. A little while before that Boruto manged to crack down on Code and in the process he witnessed the birth of a mysterious group of enemies which later arrive in Konohagakure with the intent of having their individual goals realised, stopping at no one who comes in their way. It is also revealed that one of them are responsible for Sasuke's "disappearance". Kurama has returned but this time in the form of Chakra residuals within Himawari which turns out to be essential to the current situation.</span></p>
